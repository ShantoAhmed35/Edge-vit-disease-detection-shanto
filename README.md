**Edge-ViT-FSL** is a resource-efficient AI system designed to identify crop diseases in "wild" environments. It utilizes a **MobileViT-XS** backbone enhanced with a **Saliency-Guided Attention Module (SGAM)**, achieving robust performance even when trained on limited laboratory data and tested on unseen field images.

## 🖥️ Interface Preview
The system provides real-time inference with **Explainable AI (XAI)**. The interface allows users to upload "wild" leaf images and instantly receive a diagnosis overlaid with a saliency heatmap, visualizing the specific lesions driving the AI's decision.

## 🔑 Key Innovations

* **Cross-Domain Robustness:** Tackles the "Domain Shift" problem by training on high-quality lab images (*PlantVillage*) and generalizing to noisy, real-world field data (*CCMT*).
* **Saliency-Guided Attention:** A custom Sigmoid-based module spatially gates feature maps, forcing the model to focus on pathology (lesions/spots) rather than background noise.
* **Edge-Optimized:** Designed for CPU-only inference. The model fits under **10MB** and runs at **~22 FPS**, making it viable for mobile and IoT deployment in agriculture.
* **Few-Shot Learning:** Capable of generalizing to new disease classes with minimal support samples.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric | Result | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy (Cross-Domain)** | **73.93%** | Tested on 600 episodes (5-way 5-shot) |
| **Inference Speed** | **22.13 FPS** | Standard CPU environment |
| **Latency** | **45.19 ms** | Per image |
| **Model Parameter Size** | **< 10 MB** | MobileViT-XS Backbone |

> *Note: While standard ResNet50 baselines drop to ~55% accuracy on this cross-domain task, Edge-ViT-FSL maintains robust performance due to feature alignment and saliency masking.*
